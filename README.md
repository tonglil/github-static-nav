This add-on/extension will pin the [new Github](https://github.com/blog/2085-a-new-look-for-repositories) navigation bar in a repository view to the top of the screen as you scroll down.

This keeps the tabs easy for navigation between code/issues/pull requests/etc no matter how far down the page you go.
